# Project Title

This Project Aims to develop face analytics models (CNN based models). Current project has models to estimate following information.

1. Ethinicity - Detects ethinicity from face with four classes as  [ Asian, Indian, Black, White]
2. Gender- Detects human gender [Man , Woman]
3. Emotion - Detects seven different facial emotions such as ['angry', 'disgust', 'fear', 'happy', 'sad','surprise', 'neutral'] 

## Quick Run
1. Download the race detection weights from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KI_ih8li_zmK8GyaEizKmJT2k3EeQ6TH and place in 
   "trained_models" folder ("Fweights" and "Mweights")
2. To test the output on new image siply run -

"python Api.py test_image_path   PATH_TO_SAVE_OUTPUT"

Api saves the the image at PATH_TO_SAVE_OUTPUT with bounding box drawn around the detected face with detected Ethinicity, Gender and Emotion 


### Installing

Simply clone the Repo. Project is built with python 2.7 and NOT tested with python 3


### Output 

Some Test case results are shown below

## Trained-Models

Trained models are available in folder "trained_models". All models are trained with carefully designed CNN models.
Ethinicity/ race detection model uses the transfer learning approach

Contact developer for training scripts.
